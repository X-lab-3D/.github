As structural bioinformatics group we are  interested in  bridging data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) and physics-based 3D modelling to better understand the molecular basis of health and disease and to rationalize drug design.

## Work with us!

We are looking for an enthusiastic, highly-qualified, international young researcher to join our group in a postdoc. Find mode informations [here](RU_excellence_postdoc.md)
